<p>Repository for the course Programming II - ID1019</p>

<h2>Course summary</h2>

<p>
This course covered two crucial programming paradigms: functional programming and multi-threaded programming. Topics included recursion, pattern matching, and non-modifiable data structures in functional languages. The course aimed to enable us to use these techniques effectively. The course consisted of 9 mandatory assignments and 4 higher-grade assignments, 2 of which were completed and one that was only partially completed.
